# powershell
Handy PowerShell scripts and modules for GIT, Azure (DevOps), and more.

Note that some of the modules have functions that make use of the New-DynamicParam module for ease of having dynamic parameters. This can be retreived from https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PowerShell/blob/master/New-DynamicParam.ps1
